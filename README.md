# Building a checkout bot with Python - selenium tutorial
Here is the video tutorial: https://youtu.be/M3OiYDQcy1g
Here is the video tutorial for part2: https://youtu.be/rrGTovcUA2k where I show you how you can save the session so you won't have to login again multiple times.

# How to run:
- Make sure you have python selenium install and it's working fine
- Add your login info in a file called: `account.py`, there must be 2 variables: `email` and `password`
- Run the bot with `python checkout-bot.py`

# Disclaimer
This is for demonstration purpose only, I didn't read the website term of service but it's probably against most website ToS and it may get you banned, so build such bots at your own risk.
